Test from visual nuts

The first exercise was resolved using a simple algorithm wrote in a single file with a main method.
  - The challenge was to create function that writes numbers from 1 to 100 or words if some requirements were meet.
 In order to that the class Exercice1 was created inside the file Exercise1.java and was created using the pilars below.
  - Modularization: The code has been modularized by moving the logic to print numbers into a separate method. This makes the code more reusable and easier to maintain.
  - Scalability: The maximum number to print has been defined as a constant, making it easier to change and making the code more scalable.
  - Improved performance: The code has been optimized by using the String concatenation operator instead of repeated calls to println. This results in improved performance, as concatenation is faster than repeated calls to println.
  - Code readability: The code has been made more readable by using proper variable names, clear and concise logic.
