Test from visual nuts

The first exercise was resolved using a simple algorithm wrote in a single file with a main method.
  - The challenge was to create function that writes numbers from 1 to 100 or words if some requirements were meet.

 In order to do that the class Exercise1 was created inside the file Exercise1.java and was created using the pillars below.
  - Modularization: The code has been modularized by moving the logic to print numbers into a separate method. This makes the code more reusable and easier to maintain.
  - Scalability: The maximum number to print has been defined as a constant, making it easier to change and making the code more scalable.
  - Improved performance: The code has been optimized by using the String concatenation operator instead of repeated calls to println. This results in improved performance, as concatenation is faster than repeated calls to println.
  - Code readability: The code has been made more readable by using proper variable names, clear and concise logic.


The second exercise was resolved using 2 classes that generates answers to all questions made.
- The challenge was to create a function that receiving a JSON as input would answer a few questions about the data.

In order to do that Exercise2 was created but to better organize and show OO knowledge an auxiliary class was developed as well and called CountryLanguages.
- Modularization: The code has been modularized by moving the logic to read and analyse JSON into a separate method and/or class. This makes the code more reusable and easier to maintain.
- Scalability: All inputs are flexible as the programmer can pass into the method call, making it easier to change and making the code more scalable.
- Improved performance: The code has been optimized by using inbuilt methods and/or properties from lists and dictionaries that are proven to be fast and reliable. This results in improved performance, as work with arrays or homemade data structures could be much more exhausting and probably slower.
- Code readability: The code has been made more readable by using proper variable names, clear and concise logic.
